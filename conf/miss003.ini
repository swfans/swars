[mission88]
; Third early version of Eurocorp "Guru"/"Friendly Persuasion" mission,
; improved M50 L16. Again there is a Scientist, protected by spiderbots
; and the Police. But the Unguided are now given commands - they first
; rush on the Scientist, and when he is dead, they go for the player
; Agents. You need to act fast to be able to save the Scientist.
; Oddly some of the unguided are unarmed, and if they survive the trek,
; they will harmlessly rub up against the player's agents. Early - fmtver=11.

; Alternate version of Church mission M50 L47 "Soul Crusader"/"The Learning".

; persuade.. Slow paced but interesting mission. Would probably have more
; stuff added if it wasn't scrapped. Early - fmtver=11.
