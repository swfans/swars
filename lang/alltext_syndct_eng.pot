"It's the ability to make decisions independently of Executive control that "
"differentiates a decisive agent from a dead agent. This unit contains "
"diamond processors in a 3D matrix integrated with the cyborg's conventional "
"cognitive biomass. It increases basic perceptions and contains trauma "
"management software to improve the cyborg's ability to withstand otherwise "
"critical damage."

"Holographic core memory decreases reaction lag and boosts persuadertron "
"range and signal strength. It also increases the cyborg's resistance to "
"attempts to persuade it. This brain model brings perceptual enhancements "
"across the board and further improvements to the trauma software, increasing "
"the cyborg's survivability margin."

msgid ""
"The apogee of portable artificial intelligence technology. At level 3 a "
"modified brain not only delivers increased health but also guarantees "
"improved targeting accuracy; hit rate and energy efficiency benefits. The "
"cyborg can be exposed to environments which would destroy the biological "
"brain almost instantly; this unit can completely backup the biological data "
"and enable the agent to continue to function."

"This is complex cellular cyberskin, weaved to provide a bullet-resistant "
"epidermis that radically reduces damage from projectile weapons. Development "
"of a pachyderm/steel mesh hybrid and careful cosmetic enhancement has "
"produced a substance that is extraordinarily tough but just as flexible as "
"normal, vat-grown cyborg flesh."

msgid ""
"This cyberskin takes advantage of the latest form of non-toxic asbestos "
"designed for use in spacecraft re-entry. When carrying out operations during "
"firestorm conditions, an agent wearing this skin would suffer far less from "
"incendiary damage than an unprotected counterpart."

msgid ""
"This is a cyberskin variant based on hydrocarbon polymer augmented by fibre-"
"optic micro-filaments. It should absorb much of the destructive power of "
"energy-based weapon systems. The energy is dispersed from the point of "
"impact around the modified agent's body, and recycled to sustain the skin's "
"protective properties."

msgid ""
"This is cutting edge cyberskin technology. The skin uses asynchronous "
"temporal phase-shifting cells to confuse targetting systems, making weapon "
"lock very hard to get. An agent wearing this skin would be almost invisible "
"to his opponents' firepower."
