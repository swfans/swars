**Syndicate Wars Port**, alternative binary for the classic Bullfrog game.

This is continuation of the project created by Unavowed and Gynvael Coldwind.

## About

**Syndicate Wars Port** is a port of the 1996 DOS game
[Syndicate Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicate_Wars)
to modern operating systems. In particular, it runs on GNU, Mac OS and Windows,
but it should also work on any system supported by the SDL library on the i386
architecture.

The port was created by disassembling the original DOS executable and replacing
the DOS-specific parts with platform-independent code, using [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/)
for input and video display, [Vorbis](https://xiph.org/vorbis/) for music and
[OpenAL](https://www.openal.org/) for sound.

An executable and some, but not all, neccessary data files are provided with this
port. This means that some of game data are not included. To install the
**Syndicate Wars Port**, you will need to have the original data from either
*Syndicate Wars CD*, or digital distribution.

## Community

If you wish to discuss the **Syndicate Wars Port** or if you have any problems,
you may post to either [doscussion page of the project repo](https://github.com/swfans/swars/discussions)
or to the Google group [syndicate-wars-port](http://groups.google.com/group/syndicate-wars-port)
 (you don't need to be a member to post).

## Installation

To install **Syndicate Wars Port**, you will need either the original *Syndicate
Wars CD*, or a *SW CD image* from digital distribution of the game. There were
several physical versions released. The multi-lingual european release, as well
as american release, were tested and will definitely work; other version were
not fully tested. Only releases for PC can be used. Releases from popular
digital distribution platforms all include one of the tested images.

The CD version which you use narrows the range of available languages.

* Multi-lingual CD contains `eng` `fre` `ita` `spa` `swe`,
* German release is required to use `ger`,
* Japaneses "SW Premium" release contains `eng` `fre` `jap`, but asian fonts
  are not supported by the port.

The steps you need to take vary depending on your operating system.

### Installing on GNU or UNIX

If you're installing on GNU or UNIX, you will have to compile from source,
and then add the neccessary data files. The steps are:

1. Insert the *Syndicate Wars CD* and make sure it is mounted, or mount a *SW CD image*
   (e.g. in `/media/cdrom`).
2. Choose an installation folder, like `/usr/local/share/swars` (this is the default).
3. Do `util/install -f <SOURCE> -t <TARGET> -l <LANG>`, where
   * *\<SOURCE\>* is the game CD path, like `/media/cdrom`,
   * *\<TARGET\>* is the destination path, meaning the installation folder you've chosen,
   * *\<LANG\>* is the installation language, and can be one of: `eng` `fre` `ger` `ita` `spa` `swe`.

   The install script will copy files from the CD or mounted CD image, but also
   will download additional data files from their repositories:
   [gfx](https://github.com/swfans/swars-gfx/releases),
   [sfx](https://github.com/swfans/swars-sfx/releases) and
   [levels](https://github.com/swfans/swars-levels/releases).
4. Now we finally get to this code repository. Download and unpack the source
   tarball or clone git repo.
5. Follow [building instructions](#general-building-instructions) below to get
   a compiled executable.
6. After the build succeeded, do `make DESTDIR=<TARGET> install` in the
   directory where build commands were executed, to copy built files into the
   *\<TARGET\>* installation folder you've chosen.

If all went well, you can now [start the game](#starting-the-game).

### Installing on Mac OS X

There is support for creating Mac OS X bundles. While you can just install
the game into the UNIX directory structure, using a bundle is a cleaner solution.

#### Making a Mac OS app bundle

If you build an application bundle, you can install the game by just drag-and-drop
into your *Applications* directory.

You can create the bundle by following these instructions:

1. Download and unpack the source tarball or clone git repo.
2. Follow [building instructions](#building-on-mac-os-x) below to get
   a compiled executable and configuration files.
3. After the code is compiled, install the data, as explained in the
   [GNU or UNIX](#installing-on-gnu-or-unix) section, to any directory,
   say `./data` (in case you wonder, the CD drive should be mounted under
   `/Volumes/SYN WARS QA 9.0`).
4. Finally, run `util/mkbundle ./data` (replacing `./data` with the directory
   you installed the data to); this will produce an application bundle named
   `Syndicate Wars.app` in the current directory.
5. If you want there to be a pretty icon for the bundle, copy `res/swars.icns`
   to `Syndicate Wars.app/Contents/Resources`.

When all is done, you can [start the game](#starting-the-game).

### Installing on Windows

There are two ways to install **Syndicate Wars Port** on Windows - either download
the installer, or download the source code and compile it by hand.
It is recommended to use the installer!

The installer requires either the original *Syndicate Wars CD* to be present in
the CD-ROM drive, or a *SW CD image* file on disk. The CD image can come from
any popular digital distribution platform. The installer will copy the files
from the original *Syndicate Wars CD* or *SW CD image*, download and install
additional data specific to the port, and optionally encode the game music to
`.ogg` files used by the port.

The *Syndicate Wars CD* or *SW CD image* is not required to play the game,
it is used only during the installation process.

If you've decided on the hand-compilation option, proceed with the following steps:

1. Insert the *Syndicate Wars CD* and make sure it is mounted, or mount a
   *SW CD image* (so that you get drive letter or path, ie. `e:`).
2. Choose an installation folder, like `c:\Program Files\swars`.
3. Use `util/install` script to both copy required files from CD and download
   additional data, and place them all into your chosen installation folder.
   If you have UNIX or GNU support on your Windows (ie. Linux Windows Subsystem,
   or MINGW, or MSYS2, or Cygwin), you can just run the script in `bash` - see
   [Installing on GNU or UNIX](installing-on-gnu-or-unix) for details.
   If you don't have that, you will have to analyze said script to figure out
   what should be copied where - detailed instructions are not part of the
   documentation. As for converting CD music into `.ogg`, in case of issues
   disable this function of the script - we will do this separately below.
4. *[optional]* Rip the game CD Audio tracks to `track_{1,2,3}.ogg` (vorbis).
5. *[optional]* Create a `music` directory inside your chosen installation
   folder, and place the previously encoded `.ogg` files there.
6. Now we finally get to this code repository. Download and unpack the source
   tarball or clone git repo.
5. Follow [building instructions](#building-on-windows) below to get
   a compiled executable and configuration files.
6. After the build succeeded, do `make DESTDIR=<TARGET> install` in the
   directory where build commands were executed, to copy built files into the
   *\<TARGET\>* installation folder you've chosen. If you've built the binary
   yourself, you already have all the tools neccessary for that install command
   to work.

You can now [start the game](#starting-the-game).

## Starting the game

The original game needed to be started with parameters to play normally. While
with SW Port this is no longer mandatory, the parameters can still be used,
and many new ones are actually available. The executable can be run with
`--help` parameter to show a short description of all aprameters.

Parameter `-w` (used in the original game) is not recommended when running on
new hardware.

The typical command line for running SW Port on bash-like shell is:

```
./swars -g
```

If running on Windows, the command line above should work as well. Though more
Windows-centric way of doing that is:


```
swars.exe /g
```

The game will start with intro animation, and then present you with a menu where
you can start playing.

In case something doesn't work, check `error.log` file generated while the game
was starting. There is also a troubleshooting page on the
[wiki page of the project repo](https://github.com/swfans/swars/wiki).

## Building

Note that you can oly build the port for x86 architecture, and you either need
32-bit OS, or 64-bit OS with 32-bit user space libraries available.

### General building instructions

To build **Syndicate Wars Port**, you will need the following:

* GNU Autotools
* GNU C compiler
* Python 3 (with module: polib)
* vorbis-tools (oggenc in particular)
* cdparanoia
* development versions of the following libraries:
  * SDL2 or SDL1.2
  * OpenAL (we recommend OpenAL Soft)
  * libvorbis
  * libogg
  * libpng
  * zlib
  * WildMIDI

Once you've made sure you have the above, proceed with the following steps:

1. go into the directory with `swars` source release (containing `conf`, `doc`, `src` etc.)
2. do `autoreconf -if` to create build scripts from templates
3. do `./configure` to make the build scripts find required toolchain and libraries
4. do `make` to compile the executable file

You should now have a working `src/swars` executable file.

#### Build example - Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit

Here are specific commands required to compile the executable on Ubuntu linux.

Install the dependencies - remember that some must be 32-bit (i386):

```
sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib lib32z1
sudo apt install python3 python3-polib
sudo apt install vorbis-tools
sudo apt install cdparanoia
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev:i386
sudo apt install libopenal-dev:i386
sudo apt install libvorbis-dev:i386 libvorbisfile3:i386
sudo apt install libogg-dev:i386
sudo apt install libwildmidi-dev:i386
```

Now as our host is ready, we can start working on the actual `swars` sources.
Go to that folder, and generate build scripts from templates using autotools:

```
autoreconf -ivf
```

Next, proceed with the build steps; we will do that in a separate folder.

```
mkdir -p release; cd release
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkgconfig" CFLAGS="-m32" CXXFLAGS="-m32" LDFLAGS="-m32" ../configure
make V=1
```

Providing `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` allows us to tell `pkg-config` command where to
search for 32-bit packages (it would use a path to 64-bit ones by default).
The `V=1` variable makes `make` print each command it executes, which makes
diagnosing issues easier.

In case you also want a debug build:

```
mkdir -p debug; cd debug
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkgconfig" CPPFLAGS="-DDEBUG -D__DEBUG" CFLAGS="-m32 -g -O0 -Wall" CXXFLAGS="-m32 -g -O0 -Wall" LDFLAGS="-m32 -g -O0 -Wall" ../configure
make V=1
```

Explanation of the parameters:

* The `-g -O0` flags make it easier to use a debugger like _GDB_ with the
  binary, by storing symbols and disabling code optimizations.
* The `-Wall` flags enable displaying more warnings during compilation.
* The `-DDEBUG -D__DEBUG` defines make the binary store more information in
  `error.log` file. First one enables verbose logging from application code,
  second does the same for libraries used.
* The flags are set separately for C preprocessor (`CPP`), compilers (`C`, `CXX`)
  and linker (`LD`). See [GNU Automake documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Programs.html)
  for details on that.

Some tests to verify the build are included in the project. To execute them:

```
make V=1 check
```

#### Build example - MSYS2 updated 2023-01 on Windows

Using Minimal System and the MinGW toolchain available within, it is possible
to build the executable using the same way as for UNIX systems, with bash and autotools.

First install the dependencies - mingw32, since we need 32-bit toolchain:

```
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-binutils mingw-w64-i686-autotools mingw-w64-i686-pkgconf mingw-w64-i686-make mingw-w64-i686-gcc
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-libpng
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-SDL2
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-openal
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-libvorbis
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-libogg
```

The WildMIDI library is not available as MSYS2 pacman package, install manually:

```
pacman -S unzip
wget https://github.com/Mindwerks/wildmidi/releases/download/wildmidi-0.4.5/wildmidi-0.4.5-win32.zip
unzip wildmidi-0.4.5-win32.zip
cp wildmidi-0.4.5-win32/*.h /mingw32/include/
cp wildmidi-0.4.5-win32/*.a /mingw32/lib/
cp wildmidi-0.4.5-win32/*.dll /mingw32/bin/
```

The Python interpeter needs to have an additional module installed:

```
pip install polib
```

Make sure the modules are installed on the Python version used during build - with MSYS2,
you often get separate `i686` and `x86_64` versions of Python. For both of them, you
can separately install `pip` package, and then add any missing modules through it.
To select specific `python3` or `pip` at command line, alter the `PATH` variable,
like in some commands in later part of the instructions.

If you do not have any Python, then install the one which fits other `i686` tools:

```
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-python3 mingw-w64-i686-python-pip
```

Now as our host is ready, we can start working on the actual `swars` sources.
We will still have to provide paths to 32-bit configuration - MSYS will prefer
folders with data for 64-bit building.
Go to the `swars` folder, and generate build scripts from templates using autotools:

```
autoreconf -ivf --include=/mingw32/share/aclocal/
```

Next, proceed with the build steps; we will do that in a separate folder.
Note how we are modifying PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variables to make shell
search for mingw32 binaries and pkg-config search for mingw32 packages before
the default mingw64 ones:

```
mkdir -p release; cd release
PATH="/mingw32/bin:$PATH" PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/mingw32/lib/pkgconfig" CFLAGS="-m32" CXXFLAGS="-m32" LDFLAGS="-m32" ../configure --prefix=/mingw32
PATH="/mingw32/bin:$PATH" make V=1
```

Depending on versions of packages, your `make` executable may be also called `mingw32-make`.
Also, the build system may expect to find `python` binary within `mingw32` folder,
failing to find it if you have it somewhere else. In both cases, just creating a symbolic
link with name expected by build system will fix the issue.

### Building on Mac OS X

Mac OS X is at its core a UNIX system. To build the **Syndicate Wars Port** it is
enough to follow the [general building instructions](#general-building-instructions).

The GCC compiler for Mac OS X comes as part of XCode, which you can get from
Apple's web site. You can also make your life a lot easier by using
[Fink](http://www.finkproject.org/) or [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/)
to install the required packages for you, instead of having to download and
compile them manually.

If you have Mac OS 10.6 ("Snow Leopard") or newer, you will need to make sure
that your libraries contain code for the i386 architecture. In MacPorts this
is achieved by using the `+universal` variant (e.g. `port -vu install libsdl2 +universal`).

When you configure your compilation toolchain and location of libraries,
you will need to pass `CFLAGS="-arch i386"`, like so:

```
./configure CFLAGS="-arch i386"
```

If you are planning to create [Mac OS app bundle](#making-a-mac-os-app-bundle),
you will also need to pass `data-path`, so your final command will be:


```
./configure --with-data-path="Syndicate Wars.app/Contents/Resources" CFLAGS="-arch i386"
```

Then, do `make` as the [general building instructions](#general-building-instructions) tell.

## Done

That's all. Have a nice play!
